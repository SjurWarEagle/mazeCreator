/**
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Iterative_implementation
 * <br>
 * A disadvantage of the first approach is a large depth of recursion â€“ in the worst case, the routine may need to recur on every cell of the area being processed, which may exceed the maximum recursion stack depth in many environments. As a solution, the same backtracking method can be implemented with an explicit stack, which is usually allowed to grow much bigger with no harm.
 * <pre>
 * 1. Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
 * 2. While the stack is not empty
 *      1. Pop a cell from the stack and make it a current cell
 *      2. If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
 *          1. Push the current cell to the stack
 *          2. Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
 *          3. Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
 *          4. Mark the chosen cell as visited and push it to the stack
